# 妙语连珠
A key aspect of financial big data is that it consists of mostly time series.

# 时间序列
金融大数据的一个关键方面是它主要是时间序列。
Advances in computing technology have made it considerably easier to look for complex patterns. This pattern-finding capability is behind a number of recent scientific breakthroughs, such as the discovery of the Higgs particle  and gravitational waves . This same capability is also at the core of many internet companies, for example, to match users with advertisers . However, the hardware and software used in science and in commerce are quite different
很多互联网公司的核心也是这个能力，例如匹配用户和广告商。然而，科学和商业中使用的硬件和软件是完全不同的。

# for science computing vs for commercial computing

Tools for scientists are typically built around high-performance computing (HPC) platforms, while the tools for commercial applications are built around cloud computing platforms.
??? 科学家的工具通常是围绕高性能计算（HPC）平台构建的，而商业应用程序的工具则是围绕云计算平台构建的。
However, the marquee application for HPC systems is large-scale simulation, such as weather models used for forecasting regional storms in the next few days 
然而，HPC系统的主要应用程序是大规模模拟，例如用于预测未来几天区域性风暴的天气模型。
In contrast, the commercial cloud was initially motivated by the need to process a large number of independent data objects concurrently
相比之下，商业云最初是由于需要同时处理大量独立数据对象的需求而产生的。
