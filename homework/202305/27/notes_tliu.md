A taper tantrum refers to the movement in bond yields caused by investor reactions to a central bank announcing future tapering of bond-buying programs. Even if the central bank does not stop purchasing bonds immediately, investors may sell off their bonds, which forces yields to rise. These sales are said to be a “tantrum” in reaction to the news of a tapering.

看起来这个就是一个投资者的不理性行为。虽然中央银行宣布的事情在未来才会做，但是很快这个消息就会被消耗掉。

对于这样子的事情，我们可以使用 cross validation，把你想测试的东西从训练集里删掉，然后测试集里面测试它。
