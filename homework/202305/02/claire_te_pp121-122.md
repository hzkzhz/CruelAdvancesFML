##### 6.3.1 Single Price Auction Example

- 略，也就是single price auction的时候有一个人下了market order单，那会按clearing price成交

##### 6.3.2 Supply and Demand

- supply schedule: lists the total volume that sellers offer at each price.
- demand schedule: lists the total volume that buyers want at each price
- Single price auctions maximize the volume of trade by setting the clear- ing price at the price where supply equals demand
