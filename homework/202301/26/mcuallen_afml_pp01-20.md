2. Virtue is in the balance.
3. Investment management is one of the most multi-disciplinary areas of research 
4. The algorithmization of finance is unstoppable.
5. An ML algorithm can spot patterns in a
100-dimensional world as easily as in our familiar 3-dimensional one. 
6. Humans are slow learners, which puts us at a disadvantage in a fast-changing world like finance.
7. People mistrust what they do not understand. Their prejudices are rooted in ignorance, for which the Socratic remedy is simple: education.
